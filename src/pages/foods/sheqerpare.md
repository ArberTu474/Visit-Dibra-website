## Diber Sheqerpare Recipe

### Ingredients:
- 10 egg yolks
- 10 sticks of unsalted butter (melted and strained)
- 2 lbs. flour

### Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks and melted, strained butter. Mix them well until thoroughly combined.
2. Gradually add the flour to the egg and butter mixture. Begin kneading the dough gently. The more you knead the dough, the better the texture will be. Aim to knead for 10-15 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
3. Shape the dough according to your preference (e.g., round, rectangular, etc.).
4. Preheat the oven to 275°F (135°C).
5. Place the shaped dough on a baking tray and bake it at 275°F until it turns a golden color.

### Syrup:

#### Ingredients:
- 2 lb sugar
- 2 and a half cups of water

### Instructions:
1. In a separate saucepan, prepare the syrup by combining 2 lb of sugar with 2 and a half cups of water.
2. Warm the syrup over low heat until the sugar dissolves completely. The syrup should be warm but not hot.

Once the sheqerpare is baked and while it's still warm, pour the warm syrup over it. Allow the syrup to soak into the sheqerpare.

Enjoy the delightful taste of Sheqerpare, a traditional sweet treat from Diber!
