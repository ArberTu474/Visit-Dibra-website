# Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park

Welcome to Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park, a pristine paradise nestled in the breathtaking landscapes of northeastern Albania. Spanning over 202 square kilometers, this national park is a haven for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.

Established in 1966 as Lura National Park, the area was later expanded and renamed Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park in 2018. Its diverse terrain, ranging from 1,500 to 2,300 meters above sea level, boasts a rich variety of flora and fauna, making it an ecological wonderland.

Dense forests of coniferous and deciduous trees, including European beech, silver fir, and black pine, carpet the surroundings, providing shelter to a multitude of wildlife. European brown bears, Eurasian lynxes, and majestic golden eagles are just a few of the enchanting creatures that call this park home.

Among the park's natural treasures are the twelve glacial lakes, formed during the ice age, each with its own unique charm and allure. The picturesque "Field of Mares" in the southern section offers stunning views of the landscape, while the shores of the lakes are teeming with a rich variety of plant life.

For history buffs, Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park holds significance as the birthplace of Albania's national hero, Gjerg Kastrioti, and is home to the third tallest mountain in the Balkans, Mount Korabi.

Despite facing challenges such as deforestation and illegal logging, ongoing conservation efforts by local NGOs and the Albanian government aim to safeguard the park's delicate ecosystem. The region's traditional tower houses, Ottoman mosques, and the quaint mining town of Kurbnesh add cultural depth to your experience.

As you embark on your journey through this awe-inspiring landscape, witness nature's resilience and immerse yourself in the serenity of Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park.
